## Overview

Little Black Book is an application that allows individuals to keep track of their sexual and reproductive health on their own terms. 
By creating unique entries of encounters, users are able to update and see all of their expereinces and keep logs of how safe they've been and create little vignettes for their own use. 

Little Black Book provides information about all NYC DOH clinics that offer free or low-cost treatment and assistance. By means of the NYC Open Data API, all locations are displayed along with pertinent information: hours and days of operation, address, phone numbers if available.

Little Black Book provides links to organizations and information catered to different demographics of people: for example, LGBTQ, Women, Domestic Abuse Victims, and more being added as the project grows.

This app was created with the intent to help people from all walks but it's primarily geared to the LGBTQ population and women, two populations that suffer from a disproprotionately high rate of sexually transmitted disease and sexual abuse. 

Hopefully, you'll be inspired or find use in what I've done!
