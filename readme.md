## Overview

Little Noir Book is an application that allows individuals to keep track of their sexual and reproductive health on their own terms. 

By creating unique entries of encounters, users are able to update and see all of their expereinces and keep logs of how safe they've been and create little vignettes for their own use. 

Little Noir Book provides information about all NYC DOH clinics that offer free or low-cost treatment and assistance. By means of the NYC Open Data API, all locations are displayed along with pertinent information: hours and days of operation, address, phone numbers if available.

Little Noir Book provides links to organizations and information catered to different demographics of people: for example, LGBTQ, Women, Domestic Abuse Victims, and more being added as the project grows.

This app was created with the intent to help people from all walks but it's primarily geared to the LGBTQ population and women, two populations that suffer from a disproprotionately high rate of sexually transmitted disease and sexual abuse. 

As of now, project is still in a very beta phase and will be deployed to Heroku within the next couple of weeks. Updates forthcoming and will be detailed within the updates section of the table of contents.

### FAQ

- **When do you think this project will be up and ready for Heroku?**
    - There are still some major functionality kinks to work out and it's a fair amount of work for one person so I ask that you please be patient. However, I do feel that I should have it up and running on Heroku, around Midsummer 2020. Please keep an eye on our updates section for more details.
